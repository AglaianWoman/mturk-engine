## Why use Mturk Engine?

The average workflow on MTurk typically involves refreshing several different pages to find and accept new HITs as they're posted. This involves precious time being spent waiting for full page reloads and manually monitoring multiple things just to *begin* making money.

MTurk Engine brings all of the things that make for an efficient workflow into a single place. You can monitor new HITs in the background, have instant feedback as to whether your accept request went through, block requesters and HITs you're not interested in, and quickly check your queue when you need to, and never have to wait for your browser to refresh a full page. 

## Installation & Usage

1. You'll need a userscript manager to use Mturk Engine. If you're using Chrome download [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en). If you're using Firefox download [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). If you already have a userscript manager you're good to move on to the next step.
